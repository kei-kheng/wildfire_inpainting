# Project Goal
- Implement a generative model to perform image inpainting on lossy images of wildfire scenes.
- Investigate collective perception in multi-agent systems.

Lossy image --> Denoising autoencoder --> Inpainting GAN --> Reconstructed, denoised image

- [James' Autoencoder](https://github.com/JamesHarcourt7/autoencoder-perception)
- [2D Shape Generator](https://github.com/TimoFlesch/2D-Shape-Generator)
- [PartialConv2d](https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv)

# Possible Improvements
- Improve model to generalize better: modify architecture to use **partial convolution**, introduce **different masks/noises**.

# To-do
- [ ] Upload zipped folders of dataset to GitHub
